| **Section Label** | The Problem |
| **Headline** | You're Leaving Money on the Table |

If your site looks cheap, customers assume your service is too. |

| 😬 | **Outdated Design** | Generic templates that make your premium fleet look like a budget rental. First impressions matter. |

- Use actual screenshots from demo sites in case studies
- Process section works well as horizontal timeline or numbered cards
- Pain points benefit from simple iconography
- CTA sections need strong visual contrast
- Consider subtle animations on scroll for benefit cards
